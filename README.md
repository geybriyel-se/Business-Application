## Current Version
**Thymeleaf Integration and MVC Enhancement**

In this version, the Job Order Management application has been enhanced with the 
integration of Thymeleaf and the adoption of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) 
architectural pattern. The primary focus of this version is to implement the MVC 
structure and core functionality of the application.

Please note that the emphasis of this version is on the backend implementation and 
the core functionality of the application, rather than the aesthetics or styling. 
The user interface may have limited visual enhancements in this stage, as the main goal 
is to establish a solid foundation for data flow, business logic, and interaction 
between the backend and frontend components.
